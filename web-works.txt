What is an HTTP request? Requests request servers to do something.
What is an HTTP response? Responses are what servers send back after it receives a request.
What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen. HTTP headers are information that you give in requests or the servers give in responses. Some examples include dates, languages, cookies, cache information, etc.
What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser? 
Browser checks computer cache to try and find the ipaddress linked to that url, then it tries to find it on the router then on an ISD server or a DNS server until it finds the address.
If an ipaddress is found, a request is sent to the server to get the html file and if the server is okay with that, it sends the html file and other relevant files back to your computer and your browser will display it.
